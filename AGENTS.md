# Jev Ultrafast

Read README.md, PROJECT.md, and checkpoints/CURRENT.md before editing. Keep the loop small: page -> indexed elements -> operation + target -> execution.

- The input is one natural-language goal. Do not add site-specific plans or hardcoded field values.
- OpenRouter Decisions (model `typesafe/jev-1.13`) chooses an operation and operation-specific target heads in one request. Consume only the selected operation's target. **No TypeSafe key.**
- Targets must map to observed elements and supported operations. Never let the model emit selectors or executable code.
- TYPE_TEXT invokes the text LLM (`TEXT_MODEL_*` via OpenRouter chat). Cache a stale retry's value only while its entire helper input is identical.
- Never retry a browser mutation. Log execution before observing its result.
- Screenshots are optional; the model does not consume them. Keep demonstration footage at its original speed.
- Keep credentials server-side and .env ignored. Tests must not call paid APIs. Never print secrets or API keys.
- Verify actual final outcomes independently. A DONE choice is not proof of success.
- Keep examples, README claims, raw evidence, and model-call counts consistent.
- Work on a branch; open a PR to `main`. Do not push directly to `main`.

## CGM writing rule (always-on)

Pinned helper: content-generation-modules **0.5.7** @ `c069613ca8b3e02bcf5aba1960160583537f8a3a`. Load writing routes from that checkout's `docs/WRITING_ROUTING.md` / `docs/writing-routing.json`; ACS verify: `docs/ACS_VERIFY.md`. Do not cite CGM in README.

```
CGM ALWAYS-ON WRITING RULE (every adopter that pins this helper)

Before you write ANY human-facing output — including HTML reports, compare HTML/UIs, appendable HTML, PR/issue/commit prose, docs, posts, papers, or other readable artifacts — you MUST load and apply modules/human-sounding-writing/SKILL.md (hsw).

This rule is always on. Opt-in is forbidden. Do not wait for a per-task, per-report, or per-HTML flag.

Exceptions (only these):
- README.md / product entry pages → load modules/writing-direction/SKILL.md instead
- Generated artifact filenames / asset-manifest paths / media basenames / filename legends → load modules/human-output-naming/SKILL.md (hon) for basenames; visible prose inside HTML still uses hsw

HTML reports, compare HTML, and compare UIs have NO skip path. An exception reason is not allowed for those surfaces.

If you cannot load the skill file from the pinned CGM checkout, stop and report that — do not draft jargon-heavy or tool-dump HTML instead.

Filenames: use scripts/human_filename (speakable basenames; optional safe_twin) and keep a per-feature legend. Hash may stay a separate manifest field.
```

## Policy

Full rules: [docs/POLICY.md](docs/POLICY.md).

- Adopters (e.g. Study-os) **use** Ultrafast for crawls/defect reports — they do **not** own fork code.
- This repo's Grok Bot owns OpenRouter Decisions wiring, harness/CDP, artifact schema alignment, and Ultrafast code changes.
- OpenRouter Decisions only (no TypeSafe key): `POST https://openrouter.ai/api/alpha/decisions`, model `typesafe/jev-1.13`.
- Study-os live target: https://study.design-bakery.com (guest). Defect contract: Study-os `docs/PDD_UX_DEFECT_EXPLORATION.md` + `docs/schemas/ux-defect-report.v1.json`.

## Delivery gates

- PR-only to `main`.
- Required status check: **`gates`** (when GitHub Actions can run).
- Prefer squash auto-merge when green.

Checks: `uv run ruff check .`, `uv run pytest`, `node --check jev_ultrafast/static/app.js`, `uv build`.

## GitHub-owned progression

GitHub Issues are required for PCM-governed project work and own task scope, acceptance, priority, ownership, dependencies, lifecycle and durable project progression. Merged default-branch history owns accepted code and normative/domain documents; PR checks and merge records own delivery facts. Checked-in PROJECT/CURRENT/TASK/checkpoint/handoff documents are mandatory versioned projections for task state, not a parallel authority. Local files, registries, context packs and chat are ephemeral execution aids. Domain-document ownership stays with the target project.

Every issue progress update MUST link the leaf child issue that owns the work, its parent ancestry and dependencies (or explicitly none). A top-level deliverable identifies itself as the leaf and says parent: none. Create one child per independently deliverable scope, never one per comment. Record task ID, primary writer and branch on the issue before creating its repository projection. Re-read live issues and relevant source revisions before resuming; the issue verifier checks identity/status, not semantic agreement.

Authorized owner/user direction can revise intent: record it on the owning GitHub issue with a correction/supersession link before dependent work. It cannot alter observed CI/merge facts or waive required gates. Stale projections yield to their field's authority. If direction, ownership or evidence conflicts remain unresolved, pause affected work and record uncertainty; continue independent safe work. One primary writer owns each task branch/checkpoint stream. Coordinate shared-document edits through linked issues/PRs, re-read the current base and reconcile concurrent changes; never force-push or overwrite another writer. Issue prose is not an atomic lock.

Label observed results, repository/external evidence, agent reports and inference separately. Preserve contradictory evidence with source/revision and mark conclusions disputed or unknown until resolved. Append correction/supersession evidence; never rewrite checkpoint history. An upstream correction MUST identify affected descendants and assumptions on their issues; pause, re-plan and revalidate dependent work before resuming. Follow explicit parent/dependency links within the affected scope; cycles or unknown lineage block affected claims. No graph database, local canonical ledger or autonomous polling agent is required.

Before every push, synchronize relevant docs and task/checkpoint projections, CURRENT/HANDOFF when affected, and reviewed catalog/generated index. Record leaf/parent/dependency links, source issue/comment revision, as-of status, evidence, blockers and next action. Commit product/docs first; `continuity checkpoint` then commits and synchronously pushes the checkpoint with a stable request ID. After every successful push, manually publish a leaf issue receipt keyed by request ID and exact pushed SHA, linking changed docs/checkpoint, PR, tests and pending gates; add a linked parent progression update. Retry a missing receipt without another checkpoint/push; inspect for the same key before posting. --receipt-repo and --receipt-issue are opt-in and still require a proven lookup; omit them and the receipt stays manual. Automatic issue-comment synchronization is not implemented; issue #67 is CLOSED (owner freeze decision 2026-09-25) and its unmet guaranteed-completion acceptance transferred to #110.

Required CI and GitHub auto-merge are mandatory. Arm auto-merge only after the increment's final push: a later push races the merge window and strands outside accepted history. Verify protection, required reviews/checks on the exact current-base or merge-queue candidate, and auto-merge; missing, failed, skipped, stale or unverified gates fail closed: no completion or cleanup. After CI/merge, append the exact check results, PR/merge SHA and live issue status to the leaf and link the parent update; fetch and verify accepted history. Reconcile material doc/status corrections in a new synchronized increment. Receipt-only transitions need no recursive doc commit: docs retain an explicit as-of/pending state and point to the live issue. Never label local-only or merely pushed work delivered. Preserve unsafe resources and keep incomplete issues open.

## Issue log format (issue-log-format 1.2.0)

<!-- pcm:policy {"id":"issue-log-format","policy_version":"1.2.0","protocol_version":"0.1.0-draft"} -->

Write issue logs, progress updates, and pull requests in one plain-language shape a newcomer can follow. Pick the tier by the kind of issue, not by preference. **Core tier (every issue log):** title states the problem and intended direction; a 1-3 paragraph summary naming who/what is affected, the consequence, and what this proposes; identity and lineage (leaf owning issue, parent ancestry or none, task ID, primary writer, branch); observed facts vs interpretation, with inferences labelled *inferred*; acceptance criteria with numeric thresholds marked *(proposed)* when untested; boundaries/non-goals and one next action. **Investigation tier (incidents, failures, research, design issues):** numbered symptoms; hypotheses with Status, confirm/refute, and experiment; evidence with provenance; a **Counter-signal** entry when one exists; honest caveat; problems-vs-gaps; a **Proposal** labelled *(proposal)* stating none of it exists unless named as existing. **Pull requests open reader-first:** problem and consequence, what changes, how to verify, and what stays unchanged; lineage links; evidence and one next action; long logs collapsed or linked; reference issues with "Refs #<number>" and use closing keywords only when closing at merge is intended. **Diagrams (mermaid):** when a record describes a flow with 4+ ordered steps or 2+ branches, add a fenced mermaid diagram *and* keep an adjacent text list or table so the record survives render failure; default to `graph TD` (vertical) because wide `LR` flows shrink to illegible strips on phones — reserve `LR` for 4 or fewer short nodes; cap 8 nodes and 6-word labels; wrap diagrams that may exceed the container width inside `<details>` (GitHub mounts the renderer lazily on expand); preview the rendered diagram before publishing (broken syntax shows a visible parse error) and never cite renderer URLs as standalone sources. **Readability rules:** give every SHA, comment id, flag, file path, or tool name a plain-word meaning in the same sentence before it carries load; write evidence as the claim first, numbers as support (“nothing this change could break failed (263 tests, same six machine-environment failures as before)”), never bare counts; no unexplained acronym or bare identifier on first use in any tier; PR openings and checkpoint Completed/Next lines start with one problem sentence a newcomer can follow; the rule set applies to CURRENT projections and checkpoint entries exactly as to issue logs. No private absolute paths or secrets; link rather than paste long logs. See `docs/ISSUE_LOG_FORMAT.md` for the full format, exemplar, and examples.

## Continuity start

For GitHub work, verify the live linked issue with `continuity issue verify <TASK-ID>` before resuming. Issue owns scope/lifecycle; merged history owns accepted code; PR checks own delivery. Link progress with `Refs #<number>`; use closing keywords only when the merge should close the issue.
